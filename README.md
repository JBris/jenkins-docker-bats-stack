### Introduction

This repo combines Jenkins, Bats, and Docker together to provide a simple example of the CI/CD process. Execute `build.sh` to get started.

### Jenkins

Execute [get-plugins.sh](services/jenkins/scripts/get-plugins.sh) to retrieve a list of installed plugins within your Jenkins master instance. You can use `make get-plugins` to call the script from within the Jenkins container.

Execute [sync-plugins.sh](services/jenkins/scripts/sync-plugins.sh) to install all the plugins listed within the [plugins.txt](services/jenkins/resources/plugins.txt) file. You can use `make sync-plugins` to call the script from within the Jenkins container.

During your initial installation of Jenkins, execute `make init-admin-password` to retrieve the initial, autogenerated administrator password. Note that this password will be visible in the shell.

A fairly simple [example Jenkins file](Jenkinsfile) has been included. This file will execute the battery of tests included in the [tests directory](tests).
